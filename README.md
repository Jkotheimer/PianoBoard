# PianoBoard

This repository will host my COMP 324 project called PianoBoard.

This will be an HTML website that allows the user to play their keyboard like a piano
and record different instruments on multiple tracks.  There will be a tempo setting
with the option of playing the click track over everything.  There will also be a drop
down box that allows the user to choose the instrument they would like to record
(although the keyboard is still played in the same piano format).  Ultimately, there
will be a button that compiles all of the tracks to a single Mp3 file and downloads it
to the user's computer.
